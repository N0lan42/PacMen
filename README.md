# PacMen
In this excerise we used the setInterval method to tell a function if "PacMan" hit the edge of the screen or not. We were able to create a function that was checked every 300 milliseconds with setinterval to check the pagebounds. IF PacMan hit the wall he would simply turn around and start the process over again.

To run this Program the user simply has to press on the image to start the command.
Improvements can be made in the future to allow "Pacman" to move in more directions, move smoothly and add more "PacMen" to the screen.
